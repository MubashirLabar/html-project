          he relied on to win the bulk of his fortune. Deliberately omitted from

          Impulse Words: The Psychological Loophole That Makes Buyers Buy

          “But it’s not about intelligence or experience. Humans have an IMPULSE
          to BUY things. Just like breathing and eating, this IMPULSE to BUY is
          an urge present within every one of us. Making money online is all
          about knowing the exact right words to trigger this impulse. So the
          real secret to earning a full-time income from home is focusing on
          Impulse Words. These are innocent everyday words first studied by the
          CIA that fly under-the-radar and tell you exactly what to type to
          trigger this IMPULSE to BUY causing buyers to decide to buy in just
          seconds. It’s not how smart or experienced you are. The most critical

          different. But we do know this. Jason was laughed at when he dropped
          out of college. Now these words have personally made Jason over $2

        <div class="text">
          What I have to tell you involves a scandal that’s going on in the
          “make money” industry today. It’s a scandal that - if you’re like most
          people I know - is cheating you out of making money online and
          (worse!) robbing you of extra income that should have hit your bank
          account last month. And this month. And next month too.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          It’s a mess. If you’ve ever bought a “make money” course - or have
          ever thought about buying one - then you need to hear everything I’m
          going to share with you. It’s that important. Now, maybe I need to
          remind you who I am. It may help you understand why I’m sharing the
          wild story I’m about to tell you. This is me with my dog Sterling
          (PIC). I’m a guy who makes money online.

        <div class="text">
          I dropped out of college because I was making $20K/mo from my dorm. My
          professors laughed at me. Then I became a millionaire at 24 and they
          stopped laughing. I’ve sold over $67 Million Dollars online. I’ve
          spent $3.3 million on ads in total.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Behind the scenes, I’ve been sought out for marketing advice by some
          amazing people - Jay Shetty’s team, Robert Kiyosaki’s team (Rich Dad,
          Poor Dad), Jordan Belfort’s team (Wolf of Wall St) to name a few.
          Then..
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I wrote a book called Higher Status that became a best-seller on
          Amazon. And lately..
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I’ve spent the last few years teaching others how to earn a real
          income from home too - I have over 300 students successfully earning a
          full-time income from home now (over 20 of them now have 7-figure
          businesses). But..
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I made millions of dollars in 4 different niches before I ever got
          paid to teach others how to make money online. The truth is, I started
          making money online in a strange way..
        </div>

        <div class="title">I Made My First Dollar Online On NO SLEEP.</div>
        <div class="text">This is no joke. Here’s what happened.</div>
        <div class="text">
          My first ever website was set to launch Tuesday. But by Monday, my
          website wasn’t ready. My programmer was asleep in the Philippines and
          I couldn’t reach him.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          If the site wasn’t ready, I’d be screwed because I’d already paid for
          the traffic that was coming. He was the only one that could fix the
          site.
        </div>
        <div class="text">So I stayed up all night in my dorm.</div>
        <div class="text">
          My friends partied while I sat in my room and waited.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I messaged the programmer every 30 minutes. For 9 hours.
        </div>
        <div class="text">Finally, at 6AM he replied and fixed the site.</div>
        <div class="text">By 9AM, I’d made my first sale (!).</div>
        <div class="text">
          By the end of the first week, I’d made almost $20,000. I spent it all
          on an Audi convertible. My parents were in disbelief. My friends asked
          if I’d become a drug dealer.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I’d go on to sell over $67,000,000 online over the next 13 years.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Somehow near the end, people began calling me a “make money guru”.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I never liked that title. Because I’m not a guru and I don’t have all
          the answers.
        </div>
        <div class="text">I worry about bills.</div>
        <div class="text">Sometimes I feel stuck.</div>
        <div class="text">
          Sometimes I fantasize about packing up all my shit and moving to Bali

        <div class="text">
          I’m telling you this because sometime in 2020-21 I started to feel
          burnt out.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I’d grown tired of teaching others how to make money online. I’m sorry
          but this industry just doesn’t “do it” for me.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Maybe it sounds selfish. But I like making myself money a lot more
          ..than teaching others how.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          That’s why I’ve always had online businesses outside of the ones you
          see. I wanted to focus more on those.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          So in October, I stepped down as CEO of my education company. With 44
          team members and $250,000 a month in expenses, I put a team in charge
          to lead the company.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          My plan was to step away slowly so I could focus on my other ventures.
          Then Instagram slapped me.
        </div>

        <div class="title">Man Plans, Instagram Laughs</div>
        <div class="text">
          On December 8th 2021, my Instagram account (with 2.5 Million
          Followers) was banned without warning.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Now I had a real problem. Most of the revenue came from Instagram.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          How could I afford to pay $250,000/mo in payroll and expenses without
          new money coming in? I couldn’t. Instagram forced my hand.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          So on Christmas Day, I made the impossible decision to shut my
          education company down and let everyone go. (It was a depressing
          holiday season for me.)
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I’m officially retiring from teaching others how to make money online
          - calling it quits.

          Oh, you’ll still see me. But any content I make will be VERY different
          going forward - I’m officially taking all my secret to making money
          online and keeping it for me.
        </div>

          dating industry and the personal development industry before I ever
          taught others how to make money online.) But I want you to open your
          mind for a second and realize.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Fake or not, these “gurus” are still making money online. Many are
          millionaires. And they’re all doing it using the same secret. A secret
          that works for ethical and unethical people both.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          In fact, nearly everyone who makes money online - from fake guru to
          Jeff Bezos - uses this same secret to make money online. And here’s
          where you should get angry - THEY NEVER TEACH YOU THIS SECRET.
        </div>

        <div class="title">
          They’ll teach you anything else but this. Because this is how they
          really make their money.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Listen. Humans have an impulse to buy things. We even have a name for
          it. An “impulse buy”.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Just like breathing and eating, this impulse to buy is present within
          everyone one of us. And making money online is all about knowing the
          exact right words that trigger this impulse.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          The real secret to making money online is using Impulse Words.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Impulse Words are innocent everyday words that slip under the radar
          and trigger this impulse to buy causing buyers to decide to buy
          sometimes in just seconds.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          These words have been studied by the CIA and every other intelligence
          agency on the planet.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          A few of them are even being used in this letter right now. But..
        </div>

        <div class="title">
          ...Anyone Who Knows Them Won’t Dare Talk About Them.
        </div>
        <div class="text">They’re “too good to share”.</div>
        <div class="text">
          Making money online is not about how smart or experienced you are. You
          have to know the exact right words to type - Impulse Words - the real
          secret that made me rich all these years.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I’ve often been asked how I’ve been able to turn a profit in so many
          different niches.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I started in the basketball niche. Then speed training. Then dating.
          Then personal development. Then finally. How to make money online.
          Until recently, I’ve never revealed the secret. Why should I when I’m
          already competing against the biggest sharks online?
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          But it all changed recently when I finally felt secure enough (aka
          rich enough) to reveal my secret privately.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I minted Passwords for a test group of beginners to access my
          Password-Protected List of 77 Impulse Words.
        </div>

        <div class="title">
          To Get Access, Their Fee Was $2,800 Per Password.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Suddenly I found myself tasked with teaching my system to a bunch of
          newbies.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Using Impulse Words is an art and a science. But I quickly concluded I
          couldn’t teach an art - it’s too subjective.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I realized I had to turn Impulse Words into a science. They had to be
          a repeatable set of principles that, if followed, can be counted on to
          yield the same predictable result of profit and sales.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          So I systematized the process and, most importantly, made everything
          as easy as I could possibly make it… so even a freshman in college
          could learn the system and start earning extra income virtually out of
          the gate.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          This is exactly what happened with my private test group.
        </div>

        <div class="title">
          In just 7 weeks, more than 90% of the students had made their first
          sale online.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Many went on to become household names themselves.
        </div>
        <div class="list">
          <div class="list-item">
            <span class="dot"></span>
            <div class="li">Sean Ferres, millionaire</div>

            <div class="li">Wojo, the mclaren millionaire</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="title">
          No, not all of the students in my private group made money.
        </div>
        <div class="text">About 10% of the students couldn’t “get it”.</div>
        <div class="text">
          Others tried to use my 77 Impulse Words to sell new products that had
          little market appeal.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          We learned when a new product is so flawed that only a few people want
          it, even the most powerful Impulse Words won’t sell it.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          But with products or services that had market appeal, where the only
          variable was the pulling power of our advertising, we almost never
          lost.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          All thanks to a system of Impulse Words made easy to use and apply.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          And that’s how I’ve always approached making money online - how can we
          make it easier?
        </div>

        <div class="title">
          The result of all this will be my final legacy teaching others how to
          actually make money online..
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          …for everyone who’s ready to start earning a full-time income from
          home …or more.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Today you can join the other students and claim your Password to my
          Password-Protected List of Impulse Words. But first you must keep in
          mind this:
        </div>
        <div class="border-title">Only 21,000 Passwords Were Minted</div>
        <div class="text">
          I’ve minted 21,000 Passwords to the private membership site where
          you’ll get access to everything. No more passwords will be minted
          after that. Once these 21,000 Passwords are gone, they’re gone.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          But please don’t feel pressured into joining us inside immediately
          just because only 21,000 Passwords will ever be made available.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          That’s because I’m not looking to trigger a wave of “panic buying”
          which would attract a lot of people who aren’t actually serious about
          earning a full-time income from home. My aim is just the reverse.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          I want to restrict these Passwords to a tiny slice of the community.
          For only the people like me. People who are dedicated. Ambitious.
          Ready to get started. And that by definition, is a small but elite
          group.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Best of all, the results you can see with my Password-Protected
          Impulse Words are truly fast. I was making $20,000 a month from my
          dorm room. But it isn’t only me.
